  -Uninstall Remove NSudo in the Windows directory and the context menu. 

PS:
    1. All NSudo command arguments is case-insensitive.
    2. You can use the "/" or "--" override "-" and use the "=" override ":" in
       the command line parameters.  For example, "/U:T" and "-U=T" are 
       equivalent.
    3. To ensure the best experience, NSudoC does not support context menu.

Example:
    If you want to run Command Prompt with TrustedInstaller, enable all 
    privileges and the default Integrity Level.
